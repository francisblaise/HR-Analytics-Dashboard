# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

I built an HR Analytics Dashboard that provides clear insights into employee salary, performance, attrition, and retention.

**Key Insights from my report:**
- Store Operations & Logistics recorded the highest attrition rates.
- Training hours showed a positive correlation with performance.
- Employees aged 51–64 achieved the highest performance ratings, while younger employees required more mentorship.
- Identified high potential employees for promotion using performance + satisfaction metrics.
- Department satisfaction levels were consistent (~7.2) but highlight room for improvement.

This dashboard transforms HR data into a strategic decision making tool reducing attrition, improving performance, and strengthening retention.
